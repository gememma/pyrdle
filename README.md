# Pyrdle

Pyrdle is a wordle clone written in Python! It is terminal-based, using the
`rich` library to provide rich output on the command line. It selects a
random five-letter word from a plaintext file

## Features

- selects a random word
- highlights letters based on their presence and position in the answer
- prints a score matrix at the game end like classic wordle

## Planned Features

- wordle-like GUI
- display for which letters have been used and how they scored
- ability to choose the answer length
